# EDA_TITANIC
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. This project aims to analyze the factors that influenced survival rates among the passengers and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for a given passenger based on their characteristics.</p>

<h3>Dataset Description</h3>
<p>The dataset used for this project is divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set contains 891 samples with 12 variables, while the testing set consists of 418 samples with 11 variables (excluding the target variable). The variables include passenger information such as age, gender, socio-economic status, cabin, and more.</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<p>In this section, a comprehensive analysis of the dataset is performed. The shape of the data, data types, and missing values are examined. The variables are described, and insights from background research on the Titanic disaster are provided. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to gain a deeper understanding of the data.</p>
